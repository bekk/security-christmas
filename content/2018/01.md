Welcome to the most useful Christmas Calendar you will open this year.
The world of security is very large and complex, and it is difficult to get it correct as a developer.
As a developer, you need to get everything correct, but as a hacker, it can be enough to find a small bug to do a lot of damage.

Luckily modern frameworks make the task of security much easier for a developer, but it is still very important to know what the challenges are.
Throughout these days before Christmas, we will guide you through many of the these challenges. This will give you the knowledge and some tools to find and test the most common vulnerabilities.
